title: On struggling needlessly
type: reflection

I heard they measured the stress hormones of people in various rungs in the corporate hierarchy, and they found those at the top to be *less* stressed. And they reasoned executives have a great deal of freedom over their day-to-day that subordinates didn't, and the feeling of freedom over your life is stress-relieving.

I won't argue the last; but I can think of a better explanation. As I go through life observing those around me, I notice people struggling with this or that, but the amount of struggle doesn't seem to have to do with the degree of challenge: some have few problems unless you ask them, others seem happily to go on in spite of every obstacle.

There is a skill at work here: the ability to perceive that everything's fine. Isn't life better that way. Those who get good at this will tend, as a side effect, to rise to ever-greater domains of responsibility, others staying 'stuck' where they are.
