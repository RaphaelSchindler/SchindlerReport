> The scientific understanding of dietary modulation of the human gut microbiota has been developed over several decades, with probiotics as a principal focus. While the role of probiotics has been widely advocated, it is possible that a greater number of food products will further exploit the prebiotic approach over the next few years. Prebiotics can also be added to many foods including those which are cooked or baked, which are more problematic for probiotic enrichment.
