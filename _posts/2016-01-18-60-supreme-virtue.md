> Can you coax your mind from its wandering<br>
and keep to the original oneness?<br>
Can you let your body become<br>
supple as a newborn child's?<br>
Can you cleanse your inner vision<br>
until you see nothing but the light?<br>
Can you love people and lead them<br>
without imposing your will?<br>
Can you deal with the most vital matters<br>
by letting events take their course?<br>
Can you step back from your own mind<br>
and thus understand all things?<br>
Giving birth and nourishing,<br>
having without possessing,<br>
acting with no expectations,<br>
leading and not trying to control:<br>
this is the supreme virture.
