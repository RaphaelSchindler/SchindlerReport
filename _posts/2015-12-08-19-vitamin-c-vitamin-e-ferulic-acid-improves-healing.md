> This is the first study to show that Vitamin <span class="sc">C</span>, <span class="sc">E</span>, and Ferulic acid correlate with more rapid wound healing post-fractional ablative laser.

(_Fractional ablative laser_ refers to a cosmetic skin-rejuvenating procedure; and the emerging technology of _laser-assisted drug delivery_ was used.)

Interesting that these three supplements were selected for the study.
