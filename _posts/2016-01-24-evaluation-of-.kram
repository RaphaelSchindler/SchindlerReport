> Radionuclides released into the atmosphere and the ocean by nuclear power plant accidents, such as the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters, are important problems for the ecosystems and humans. Among the released radionuclides, cesium-137 (<sup>137</sup>Cs) and strontium-90 (<sup>90</sup>Sr) are considered to be harmful to humans because both have a long half-life and can contaminate aquatic ecosystems and food products due to their high solubility in water.

And <i>Chlorella</i> could help the elimination and help prevent the absorption.
