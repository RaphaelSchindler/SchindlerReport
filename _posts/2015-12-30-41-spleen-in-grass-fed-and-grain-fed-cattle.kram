This research falls under a broad push by agriculture to improve cattle growth and meat quality. Its already having been demonstrated that "different feeding regimens could alter the nutritional composition of beef," this research investigates the impact of grass vs. grain feeding, with specific attention on the spleen, "the largest lymphatic organ in the body."

They hypothesize that under different feeding regimens the spleen may exhibit a vastly different function, caused by a diferrential expression of genes. This falls in line with the larger understanding of the burgeoning field of _epigenetics_, which suggests that under different environmental factors, such as diet and exercise, individuals can essentially choose their genetic code, by choosing which parts are expressed.
