The study focus was to clarify the association between dietary magnesium (<span class="sc">M</span>g) intake and inflammation, the latter measured via blood plasma levels of <span class="sc">C</span>-reactive protein (<span class="sc">CRP</span>):

> This meta-analysis and systematic review indicates that dietary <span class="sc">M</span>g intake is significantly and inversely associated with serum <span class="sc">CRP</span> levels. The potential beneficial effect of <span class="sc">M</span>g intake on chronic diseases may be, at least in part, explained by inhibiting inflammation.
