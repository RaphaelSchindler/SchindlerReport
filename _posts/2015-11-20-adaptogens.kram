_Adaptogens_ are the new _stimulants_: Whereas the psychotropic stimulants such as amphetamine or cocaine showed impressive metabolic up-regulation, producing the pleasing effects of an astoundingly energized physiology; when the overall influence proved rather harmful than healthful, pharmacologists began to look elsewhere. Fresh optimism was found in the fleshy-rooted perennial _ginseng_, whose properties promised enhanced physiological performance without the downside, and in the mid-20th century the term _adaptogen_ was coined to refer to a superior class of metabolic regulator.
