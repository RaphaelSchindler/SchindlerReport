An investigation of one facet of the toxicity of the widely-used pesticide Roundup: the focus is on the active ingredient, _glyphosate_, and its disruptive effect on manganese (<span class="sc">M</span>n). Drs. Samsel and Seneff explain how glyphosate could produce simultaneous <span class="sc">M</span>n deficiency and toxicity, and the pathologies that would result:

> Many diseases and conditions are currently on the rise in step with glyphosate usage in agriculture, particularly on <span class="sc">GM</span> crops of corn and soy. These include autism, [Alzheimer's], [Parkinson's], anxiety disorder, osteoporosis, inflammatory bowel disease, renal lithiasis, osteomalacia, cholestasis, thyroid dysfunction, and infertility. All of these conditions can be substantially explained by the dysregulation of <span class="sc">M</span>n utilization in the body due to glyphosate.
