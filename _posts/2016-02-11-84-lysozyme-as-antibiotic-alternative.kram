> It is clear that feeding subtherapeutic levels of antibiotics improves performance and overall health and is used extensively throughout the swine industry. However, it is also clear that swine producers are under pressure to reduce or eliminate the use of antibiotics due to concerns over antibiotic resistance. Research into possible alternatives is essential and will allow swine producers to keep the animal well-being and monetary advantages of antibiotics without the perceived negative effects of their use. Lysozyme is a natural antimicrobial already used in other facets of the food industry. In nursery pigs, lysozyme added to feed improves gastrointestinal health, reduces potential pathogen shedding, and improves growth and feed efficiency. Therefore, lysozyme is a viable alternative to traditional subtherapeutic antibiotic use in swine production.

This stepping away from antibiotics is a move in the right direction, albeit for the wrong reasons -- "concerns over antibiotic resistance" -- the long-term effects of antibiotics on human health being overlooked.

So lysozyme may be a good alternative to promote the health of agricultural animals. It remains to be seen if it can improve their growth rate, which is the real reason farmers use antibiotics. Just like the pesticide, Roundup, which, applied right before harvest, is used to increase the yield of wheat fields.
