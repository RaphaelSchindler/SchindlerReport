One way we fight tumors these days, particularly quite small ones near the skin, is using _percutaneous local ablative therapy_: the particular treatment discussed here uses electromagnetic radiation to 'zap' them.

Its having been observed that zapping a tumor induces it to produce heat shock proteins, here they apply _quercetin_ to the tumor, which downregulates this heat shock protein production, and they observe an improved therapeutic outcome.
