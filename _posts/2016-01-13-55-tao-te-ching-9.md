In Western society the predominant health-deranging habits are not habits of eating or exercise, but habits of *thought*. It's not just the over-consumption of the wrong foods that makes us sick, but the wrong ideas. It pays to readjust our perspective.

Chapter nine from the Tao Te Ching (in completion):

> Fill your bowl to the brim<br>
and it will spill.<br>
Keep sharpening your knife<br>
and it will blunt.<br>
Chase after money and security<br>
and your heart will never unclench.<br>
Care about people's approval<br>
and you will be their prisoner.<br>
Do your work, then step back.<br>
The only path to serenity.
