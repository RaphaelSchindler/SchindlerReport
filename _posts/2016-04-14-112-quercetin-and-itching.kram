> Quercetin has a skin protective effect against damage caused by a variety of insults, including <span class="sc">UV</span> radiation, histamine, or contact with toxic chemical compounds. Indeed, quercetin is able to reduce redness, itching, and inflammation of damaged skin; it may also help restore skin barrier function, increasing hydration, and reducing water loss.

I've found quercetin's ability to prevent and heal sunburn to be so great that I've stopped using sunscreen.
