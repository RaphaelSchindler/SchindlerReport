Here they test whether special fancy-pants sugars called [_fructooligosaccharides_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructooligosaccharide) may benefit those with the metabolic condition. I can't recall the attribution, but I remember hearing that these fructooligosaccharides are sugars which can only be digested by a few organisms, certain healthful bacteria in the gut; and a tactic for encouraging the growth of these beneficial bacteria is to give them food that can't be taken away from them by gut's more rapacious and less healthful occupants.

The scientists corroborate my vague assertion: "Oligofructose-enriched inulin can change composition of the gut microflora toward bifidobacteria and lactobacilli."

And they conclude:

> We demonstrated that supplementation with oligofructose-enriched inulin [not a spelling mistake] resulted in a significant decrease in body weight and <span class="sc">BMI</span> [body-mass index].

But:

> The exact mechanism(s) of weight reduction by oligofructoseâ€“enriched inulin remains unclear.

And they unsurprisingly miss the point about the gut's microflora being altered, and search for more 'chemical' reasons for the benefits. I don't know, but my opinion is that the influence of the gut microbiome on health is not just *significant*, it's *everything*. ...I say 'unsurprisingly' because even in the last sixty days of reading through scientific research in the domain of health and nutrition, I have seen the marked biases from the influences of: first, free-market capitalism, which determines which health questions receive attention; and second, of dogmatic education and herd mentality (even in the scientific community), which slows down radical shifts in scientific awareness.

Let's put it this way: they can't be right about everything; they must be quite wrong in certain fundamental assertions; and I believe this is one of them. The health community at large is yet to wake up to the reality that humans and microorganisms interact symbiotically.

On a recent ski trip to Revelstoke (not that it matters, but...jealous?), in the mid-mountain lodge there was a hand-sanitizing stand, above which was posted the message "Health begins with clean hands." I think that statement must be categorically wrong. Health 'begins' with nature; and nature isn't sterile.
