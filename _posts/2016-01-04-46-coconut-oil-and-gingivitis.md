Here the method of application is interesting: they study oil 'pulling' or 'swishing' therapy, which involves rinsing or swishing oil in the mouth. Their findings:

> A statistically significant decrease in the plaque and gingival indices was noticed from day 7 and the scores continued to decrease during the period of study.

Interestingly, coconut oil is about 90% saturated fat, of which half is _lauric acid_, a fatty acid with proven anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects; and "human breast milk is the only other naturally occurring substance with such a high concentration of lauric acid."
