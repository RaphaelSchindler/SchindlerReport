The hypothesis was confirmed that a short-term deficiency of magnesium intake would result in <span class="sc">DNA</span> fragmentation, lipid peroxidation, and cell death. <span class="sc">DNA</span> fragmentation doesn't sound like a good thing, and it isn't. Lipid peroxidation happens when cells get assaulted by free radicals: the cell membrane, made up almost completely of fats, goes rancid (gross). Also, some cells just committed suicide, a phenomenon called _apoptosis_.
