_Helicobacter pylori_ having been found to exert a tolerogenic effect -- 'infected,' your immune system is down-regulated, and you're less likely to suffer inflammatory disorders such as asthma, lupus, and inflammatory bowel disease -- the mechanism is studied whereby the bacterium, through interacting with the dendritic cells, is able to 'program' the immune system.
