> Diabetes is frequently associated with <span class="sc">M</span>g [magnesium] deficit. ... Future prospective <span class="sc">RCT</span>s [randomized controlled trials] are needed to support the potential role of dietary Mg [magnesium] supplementation as a possible public health strategy to reduce diabetes risk in the population.

As conspicuous as the link is between diabetes and magnesium deficit, it raises uncomfortable questions that the matter has not yet received adequate attention by the scientific community. Free-market dynamics give preference to capital-generating activity, and so we cannot be surprised when a majority of funding goes into the lucrative area of pharmaceutical research rather than into exploring a micronutrient that, say it was found effective, would not only be unprofitable, but would pose a serious competitive risk to established vested interests.
