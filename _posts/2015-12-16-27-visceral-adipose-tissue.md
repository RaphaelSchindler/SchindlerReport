Humans have two types of fat, _white_ and _brown_, and both are interesting. Until this century, we didn't know humans had any brown fat -- in fact, the scientific consensus was a firm *belief* to the contrary. White fat, on the other hand, was believed to be already well-understood.

There has been a resurgence of interest in white fat, and particularly _visceral adipose tissue_ (<span class="sc">VAT</span>), or abdominal fat. Turns out, white adipose tissue is not simply a storage facility for energy, but a fully-fledged organ of the endocrine system: it doesn't simply store and release energy, but plays a vital role in governing the energetic state of the body.

Abdominal fat has been found to have special meaning in health and wellbeing. When it nears its 'capacity,' that is, when the body has to scramble to produce more fat cells to store the excessive consumption, a deleterious feedback loop could be started, and sufferers of inflammatory disorders such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus are those in whom this cycle has been well established.
