They find corroborating evidence that long-term cold exposure creates positive changes in the body; brown fat tissue gets activated and the breakdown of fats increases.

To understand how cold-exposure might be health-promoting, you have to be acquainted with the principle of _hormesis_. The term comes from the study of toxic substances, where it was found that a small dose of a toxin has the opposite effect from a larger dose; whereas a 'large' dose may kill you, a 'tiny' dose will probably make you healthier. It is somewhat analagous to the adage, 'what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.'

The key to being healthy is to provoke yourself in the right way (at the right time), and to give yourself the resources needed to respond in a healthy way. So with exercise, we create an oxidative crisis in our body; but the healing response is to revitalizes us. Cold exposure is a way to exercise a part of us we never knew we had -- the so-called brown fat, or brown adipose tissue.
