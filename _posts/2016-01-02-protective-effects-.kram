Another clue to the efficacy of Spirulina supplementation in cases of neurodegenerative pathology. In Parkinson's it's the dopaminergic system that gets compromised, and my interest is piqued because dopamine is the 'adventure-seeking' chemical. Could Spirulina support the dopaminergic system in 'healthy' individuals?
