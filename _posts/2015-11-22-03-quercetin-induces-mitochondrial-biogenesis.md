<!-- Abstract:

> The regeneration of mitochondria by regulated biogenesis plays an important homeostatic role in cells and tissues and furthermore may provide an adaptive mechanism in certain diseases such as sepsis. The heme oxygenase (<span class="sc">HO</span>-1)/carbon monoxide (<span class="sc">CO</span>) system is an inducible cytoprotective mechanism in mammalian cells. Natural antioxidants can provide therapeutic benefit, in part, by inducing the <span class="sc">HO</span>-1/<span class="sc">CO</span> system. This study focused on the mechanism by which the natural antioxidant quercetin can induce mitochondrial biogenesis in <span class="sc">H</span>ep<span class="sc">G2</span> cells. We found that quercetin treatment induced expression of mitochondrial biogenesis activators (<span class="sc">PGC</span>-1Î±, <span class="sc">NRF</span>-1, <span class="sc">TFAM</span>), mitochondrial <span class="sc">DNA</span> (mt<span class="sc">DNA</span>), and proteins (<span class="sc">COX IV</span>) in <span class="sc">H</span>ep<span class="sc">G2</span> cells. The <span class="sc">HO</span> inhibitor <span class="sc">S</span>n<span class="sc">PP</span> and the <span class="sc">CO</span> scavenger hemoglobin reversed the effects of quercetin on mitochondrial biogenesis in <span class="sc">H</span>ep<span class="sc">G2</span> cells. The stimulatory effects of quercetin on mitochondrial biogenesis could be recapitulated in vivo in liver tissue and antagonized by <span class="sc">S</span>n<span class="sc">PP</span>. Finally, quercetin conferred an anti-inflammatory effect in the liver of mice treated with <span class="sc">LPS</span> and prevented impairment of mitochondrial biogenesis by <span class="sc">LPS</span> _in vivo_. These salutary effects of quercetin _in vivo_ were also antagonized by <span class="sc">S</span>n<span class="sc">PP</span>. Thus, our results suggest that quercetin enhances mitochondrial biogenesis mainly via the <span class="sc">HO</span>-1/<span class="sc">CO</span> system _in vitro_ and _in vivo_. The beneficial effects of quercetin may provide a therapeutic basis in inflammatory diseases and sepsis. -->
