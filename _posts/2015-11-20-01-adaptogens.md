_Adaptogens_ are the new _stimulants_: Whereas the psychotropic stimulants such as amphetamine or cocaine showed impressive metabolic up-regulation, producing the pleasing effects of an astoundingly energized physiology; when the overall influence proved rather harmful than healthful, pharmacologists began to look elsewhere. Fresh optimism was found in the fleshy-rooted perennial _ginseng_, whose properties promised enhanced physiological performance without the downside, and in the mid-20th century the term _adaptogen_ was coined to refer to a superior class of metabolic regulator.

<!-- The problem with stimulants was that they were indiscriminately stimulating, sometimes inducing cell damage from excitotoxic stress. Adaptogens, whose mechanism of action is only beginning to be understood, seem to exert a different effect: by enhancing the ability of cells to regulate metabolic activity, adaptogens 'normalize' physiological function, up-regulating lethargic cells, down-regulating over-excited ones; and it just so happens that this 'returning to normal' produces an overall energetic feeling too. -->
