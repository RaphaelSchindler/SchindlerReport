They intermittently-fasted rats for 30 days and then induced inflammation in the brain to investigate any protective effect from the dietary practice. And yeah, even this imperfect model of intermittent fasting -- the rats were fasted every other day, but a daily shorter-duration fast would be preferrable -- even this model showed significant benefits, most notably to memory.
