    </h1>

    <p>“This review discusses [the] current understanding of the relationship between [mesenchymal stem cells] and metabolic syndrome.”</p>

<p>“Metabolic syndrome is an obesity-based, complicated clinical condition that has become a global epidemic problem with a high associated risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes or glucose dysmetabolism are the major factors constituting metabolic syndrome, and these factors are interrelated and share underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.”</p>

<p>“Mesenchymal stem cells are multipotent cells with the potential to differentiate into a variety of cell lineages including fat, bone, cartilage, muscle, and marrow stroma.”</p>

<p>Though adipogenesis is a multistep process, for practical purposes it is typically illustrated in two major phases: determination, and terminal differentiation. The determination phase involves a (pluripotent) stem cell’s committing itself to the adipocyte lineage (i.e. committing to becoming a fat cell); the terminal differentiation phase involves the fibroblastic preadipocyte’s taking on characteristics of the spherical mature adipocyte, in that it can synthesize and transport lipids and secrete adipocyte-specific proteins, and it contains the machinery necessary for insulin sensitivity.</p>

<p>“Obesity is considered the main culprit of metabolic syndrome;” adipogenesis, or the creation of fat cells, is essential to obesity; and “[mesenchymal stem cells] are a major cell source for adipogenesis.”</p>

<p>“It is well known that exercise suppresses obesity. Interestingly, Rubin et al. hypothesized that low-magnitude mechanical signals would suppress adiposity, not by metabolizing existing adipose tissue but instead by suppressing the differentiation of MSCs into adipocytes.”</p>

<p>In other words, they propose that exercise keeps you thin not only by using up extra energy, but that the movement itself may be keeping stem cells from developing into new fat cells.</p>

<p>The phytochemicals of interest to the scientists were the polyphenols (or phenolics), which are flavonoids and phenolic acids. These are what they think reduces gout and hypertension.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The phenolics composition of the guava leaves extract revealed that it contained the flavonoids: Quercetin, kaempferol, catechin, quercitrin, rutin, luteolin, and epicatechin; with quercetin being the most abundant flavonoid, followed by kaempferol. The result further revealed that the extract contained the phenolic acids: Caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and gallic acids; with caffeic acid, followed by chlorogenic acid as the most abundant.</p>

    <p>Before they propose their innovative encapulation technology that preserves the biological function of astaxanthin, they sing the molecule’s praises:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There has been considerable interest in the biological functions of carotenoids in preventing degenerative diseases such as atherosclerosis, cancer, and aging. Carotenoids are the most widely distributed class of pigments in nature. Astaxanthin…is the main keto-carotenoid found in many marine organisms and birds. … A number of studies have demonstrated that astaxanthin has much stronger antioxidant activity than vitamin <span class="sc">E</span> and <span class="sc">β</span>-carotene, and is significantly more effective than <span class="sc">β</span>-carotene and lutein at preventing the <span class="sc">UV</span> light photooxidation of lipids. In addition, the anti-cancer activity of astaxanthin in mammals has been evaluated. Compared to rats fed with carcinogens only, rats fed with carcinogen but supplemented with astaxanthin revealed a significant decrease in the incidence of induced colon cancer. The protective effect of astaxanthin was even more pronounced than that of <span class="sc">β</span>-carotene. The growth-inhibitory effects of the astaxanthin-rich <em>Haematococcus pluvialis</em> extracts in <span class="sc">HCT</span>-116 colon cancer cells were reported. Astaxanthin inhibits cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner by arresting cell cycle progression and promoting apoptosis.</p>

<p>So here is research that illuminates the effectiveness of curcumin as a supplement. This paper looks to me to be making a case for the (proprietary?) technology of nanoparticles as a way to deliver the drug. I’m suspicious about the limitations mentioned, because isn’t it convenient to find fault with the unpatentable substance. It’s like poo-pooing cannabis compared with pharmacologically-modified cannabis, because obviously the latter is a money-maker, and the former, not so much.</p>

<p>Hmm. I wonder if consuming turmeric is superior to consuming the extracted curcumin. I wonder if the absorption improves if the substance is ingested in its natural ‘medium.’</p>

    </h1>

    <p>Passing over the study objective, I am intrigued by the link between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (<span class="sc">NAFLD</span>) and gut dysbiosis.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A “two-hit” hypothesis has been used to explain the pathophysiology of <span class="sc">NAFLD</span>: the first hit, fat ectopic accumulation in liver (steatosis), results in liver sensitive to hepatic oxidative stress and inflammation, known as the second hit and leads to <span class="sc">NASH</span> [nonalcoholic steatohepatitis].</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Recent studies have pointed out that intestinal microbiota plays a crucial role in both “hits” of <span class="sc">NAFLD</span>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They make the fascinating tangential remark that the intestinal microbiota – consisting of “bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses” – contains almost 150 times more genetic material than the (human) host’s <span class="sc">DNA</span>. To give an idea of the incredible complexity of the non-human ecosystem within us.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Gut bacteria affect nutrient digestion and absorption and produce secondary products such as medium and short-chain fatty acids. Moreover, intestinal microbiota influences host energy homeostasis; transplanting gut microbiota from obese mice induces body weight elevation in germ-free mice. Another gut microbiota transplantation study illustrates its capability to regulate the expression of hepatic genes for de novo lipogenesis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I must admit this gave me goosebumps. A new understanding has just clicked in my mind. I have long felt the significance of the gut microbiome vis-a-vis human physiological functioning: the fact that digestion is highly influenced by the microbiome, and even mood and cravings, I had already known. And I had already been (correctly) thinking of the liver as the ‘brain’ of the body. But only now do I feel strongly the link between these two principal actors. There’s a dialogue going on there, isn’t there? – Liver and microbiome.</p>

<p>Can you believe that if you take the bacteria from the gut of a fat person, and put it into a thin one, the thin one starts getting fat? Well that’s exactly what the mounting evidence is indicating.</p>

Conversely, when they’re injected, and the voles are prevented from having sex, a life-long bond still results.

  <li>The gall bladder is like a little bulb, complete with its own sphincter (so now you have two!), that through squeezing itself and control of the sphincter injects a fluid into the digestive system, and the ‘injection site’ is the <em>duodenum</em>, which is the tube leaving the stomach.</li>
  <li>The injected fluid, <em>bile</em>, is what causes the digestion of fats.</li>

<blockquote>

    <p>I heard they measured the stress hormones of people in various rungs in the corporate hierarchy, and they found those at the top to be <em>less</em> stressed. And they reasoned executives have a great deal of freedom over their day-to-day that subordinates didn’t, and the feeling of freedom over your life is stress-relieving.</p>

<p>I won’t argue the last; but I can think of a better explanation. As I go through life observing those around me, I notice people struggling with this or that, but the amount of struggle doesn’t seem to have to do with the degree of challenge: some have few problems unless you ask them, others seem happily to go on in spite of every obstacle.</p>

<p>There is a skill at work here: the ability to perceive that everything’s fine. Isn’t life better that way. Those who get good at this will tend, as a side effect, to rise to ever-greater domains of responsibility, others staying ‘stuck’ where they are.</p>

    <p>Today I completed my vow to make a hundred posts in as many days. I thought I’d step back and reflect on what I’m doing.</p>

<p>I was told recently to eschew peanut butter unless it was organic, that the peanut crop is known to ‘soak up’ toxins, that farmers ‘use it to refresh the soil after repeated pesticide applications.’ Regardless how true, the question that immediately arose in my mind was, ‘Well why don’t we know about this?!’</p>

<p>We don’t know because ‘they’ aren’t telling us. But who are ‘they?’ We could cast aspersions on the corporate interests that keep us fed as well as informed improperly, but what’s that to the matter? We’d only be betraying our näiveté, that we think others have our best interests at heart. But their purpose decidedly isn’t that we may be healthy, but that they may be enriched.</p>

    <p>There is in recent years a renewed interest in fat, which doesn’t work very much like we thought it did.

<p>The current study is an investigation into a signalling molecule, <em>mimecan</em>, whose function remains mysterious; and the results suggest that “mimecan is a hormone, playing important roles in the regulation of food intake.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Leptin was the first identified adipose-derived hormone that regulates food intake. Because mimecan is an anorexic hormone abundantly expressed in adipose tissue, similar to the characteristics of leptin, we further investigated the correlation between mimecan and leptin.</p>

    <p>They test whether a fructose-rich diet throws off the gut microbiome.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The contribution of high-fructose diets to the development of obesity remains controversial, since some authors have not observed unequivocal evidence linking fructose consumption with metabolic disorders. To address this issue, studies with animal models have proven particularly informative. A recent study performed with nonhuman primates has shown that even in the absence of weight gain, fructose rapidly causes liver damages and that hepatic steatosis relates to the duration of fructose consumption. Previous experiments showed that, even if the caloric intake is the same, a fructose-rich diet given to adult rats induced obesity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many have espoused a ‘calories in, calories out’ paradigm of weight loss. There is now ample evidence to update their view. But who’s going to tell the people?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The main result of this study is that in fructose-fed rats the development of metabolic syndrome directly correlates with the alteration of the microbial composition of the gut.</p>

<p>We still don’t know why antibiotic-use leads to weight gain, but it does, and the agricultural industry knows this very well.</p>

<p>What is extremely fascinating to me is that we can’t seem to accept that we too are mammals, and this weight-gain effect applies to us. It’s fascinating because human psychology operates to obscure the discovery of an important truth.</p>

    </h1>

    <blockquote>
  <p>It is clear that feeding subtherapeutic levels of antibiotics improves performance and overall health and is used extensively throughout the swine industry. However, it is also clear that swine producers are under pressure to reduce or eliminate the use of antibiotics due to concerns over antibiotic resistance. Research into possible alternatives is essential and will allow swine producers to keep the animal well-being and monetary advantages of antibiotics without the perceived negative effects of their use. Lysozyme is a natural antimicrobial already used in other facets of the food industry. In nursery pigs, lysozyme added to feed improves gastrointestinal health, reduces potential pathogen shedding, and improves growth and feed efficiency. Therefore, lysozyme is a viable alternative to traditional subtherapeutic antibiotic use in swine production.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This stepping away from antibiotics is a move in the right direction, albeit for the wrong reasons – “concerns over antibiotic resistance” – the long-term effects of antibiotics on human health being overlooked.</p>

<p>So lysozyme may be a good alternative to promote the health of agricultural animals. It remains to be seen if it can improve their growth rate, which is the real reason farmers use antibiotics. Just like the pesticide, Roundup, which, applied right before harvest, is used to increase the yield of wheat fields.</p>

But they observe something I found fascinating, second, regarding the ‘average daily gain’ metric – the amount of a pig’s daily weight gain. They observe:</p>

    <p>If you’re fat, you’re in line to get colo-rectal cancer; grape seed extract may diminish your chances.</p>

<p>Most interesting is that they find the extract provokes the ‘browning’ of white fat. Brown fat cells are like a sink for excess energy – they turn calories into body heat. If you’re fat, it’s because the body can’t come to grips with how much caloric influx there is, and as soon as you have even a bit of a belly, a derangement has occurred that puts you on the road called ‘metabolic syndrome,’ which doesn’t lead anywhere good. (As an aside: we know that women are less likely to develop a belly than men; and that’s why women can carry more fat while being healthy; it is really something specific to a belly that indicates a metabolic derangement.)</p>

<p>The browning of fat greatly interests me. Just imagine if you had loads of brown fat cells: You’d be able to really indulge in food – one of the best indulgences there is – without worrying about losing your six-pack. It takes work to proliferate the cells, and patience, but the results are well worth it.</p>

Watch the turmoil of beings,<br />
but contemplate their return.<br />
Each separate being in the universe<br />
returns to the common source.<br />
Returning to the source is serenity.<br />
If you don’t realize the source,<br />
you stumble in confusion and sorrow.<br />
When you realize where you come from,<br />
you naturally become tolerant,<br />
disinterested, amused,<br />
kindhearted as a grandmother,<br />
dignified as a king.<br />
Immersed in the wonder of the Tao,<br />
you can deal with whatever life brings you,<br />
and when death comes, you are ready.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Disruption of the gut microbiota by antibiotics leads to a loss of “colonization resistance” due to the depletion of commensal bacteria. Microbiota-host mutualism depends on the cooperative flexibility established by the innate and adaptive immune system.

    </h1>

    <p>Here they test whether special fancy-pants sugars called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructooligosaccharide"><em>fructooligosaccharides</em></a> may benefit those with the metabolic condition. I can’t recall the attribution, but I remember hearing that these fructooligosaccharides are sugars which can only be digested by a few organisms, certain healthful bacteria in the gut; and a tactic for encouraging the growth of these beneficial bacteria is to give them food that can’t be taken away from them by gut’s more rapacious and less healthful occupants.</p>

<p>The scientists corroborate my vague assertion: “Oligofructose-enriched inulin can change composition of the gut microflora toward bifidobacteria and lactobacilli.”</p>

<p>And they conclude:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We demonstrated that supplementation with oligofructose-enriched inulin [not a spelling mistake] resulted in a significant decrease in body weight and <span class="sc">BMI</span> [body-mass index].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The exact mechanism(s) of weight reduction by oligofructose–enriched inulin remains unclear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And they unsurprisingly miss the point about the gut’s microflora being altered, and search for more ‘chemical’ reasons for the benefits. I don’t know, but my opinion is that the influence of the gut microbiome on health is not just <em>significant</em>, it’s <em>everything</em>. …I say ‘unsurprisingly’ because even in the last sixty days of reading through scientific research in the domain of health and nutrition, I have seen the marked biases from the influences of: first, free-market capitalism, which determines which health questions receive attention; and second, of dogmatic education and herd mentality (even in the scientific community), which slows down radical shifts in scientific awareness.</p>

<p>Let’s put it this way: they can’t be right about everything; they must be quite wrong in certain fundamental assertions; and I believe this is one of them. The health community at large is yet to wake up to the reality that humans and microorganisms interact symbiotically.</p>

<p>On a recent ski trip to Revelstoke (not that it matters, but…jealous?), in the mid-mountain lodge there was a hand-sanitizing stand, above which was posted the message “Health begins with clean hands.” I think that statement must be categorically wrong. Health ‘begins’ with nature; and nature isn’t sterile.</p>

    </h1>

    <p>An insight in my understanding of the nutritional benefits of sprouted seeds: Seeds have evolved to survive, so it is conceivable that they contain substances to frustrate their being digested. However, it is intuitive to me that the transition from a dormant to a living state may require, so to speak, everything the seed has; and for a moment it is profoundly fragile; which fragility translates, from our point of view, as digestibility.</p>

<p>Further, I could see the seed as a sort of stockpile of resources, as well as a protective home to a dormant kernel of life. While this ‘stockpile’ is nutritious to us, our body must do the work of converting the raw materials to biologically significant molecules. Why not let the organism start this work for us? A sprouted seed is no longer just a container of materials, but a living thing, whose biological components are of higher nutritional value to our digestion than the raw materials from which they emerged.</p>

    <p>Here rigorous scientific inquiry is used to find the proportions of ingredients that would lead to an optimally probiotic beverage.</p>

<p>They argue in the preamble that there is market potential for such a product:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Due to huge expenditure on health care each year, consumers’ desire for food products with desired health benefits continues to grow. Consumers are interested in foods that boost the immune system, reduce the risk of disease and enhance health, which consumers self-prescribe for themselves and their families. Nowadays functional foods are gaining public acceptance in many countries. The market surveys showed that there is great scope for value-added as well as health promoting food products.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know I must let go of emphasizing, at the slightest provocation, that food is <em>supposed to</em> be health-promoting. Here again we have the adjective <em>functional</em> applied to food: food that actually <em>works</em> (the way it’s supposed to).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A major development in functional foods pertains to foods containing probiotics and prebiotics which enhance health promoting microbial flora in the intestine. There is growing scientific evidence to support the concept that live microorganisms when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host by improving its intestinal microbial balance.</p>

    <p>They find corroborating evidence that long-term cold exposure creates positive changes in the body; brown fat tissue gets activated and the breakdown of fats increases.</p>

<p>To understand how cold-exposure might be health-promoting, you have to be acquainted with the principle of <em>hormesis</em>. The term comes from the study of toxic substances, where it was found that a small dose of a toxin has the opposite effect from a larger dose; whereas a ‘large’ dose may kill you, a ‘tiny’ dose will probably make you healthier. It is somewhat analagous to the adage, ‘what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.’</p>

<p>The key to being healthy is to provoke yourself in the right way (at the right time), and to give yourself the resources needed to respond in a healthy way. So with exercise, we create an oxidative crisis in our body; but the healing response is to revitalizes us. Cold exposure is a way to exercise a part of us we never knew we had – the so-called brown fat, or brown adipose tissue.</p>

    <p>Somehow, in situations where an important organ (in this case the spinal cord) isn’t getting enough oxygen, kefir is able to alleviate the resultant oxidative stress and neuronal degeneration. The experimental dose was 10 ml per kg of body mass; for me that translates to 800 ml of kefir daily (not that I plan to take as much).</p>

<p>It’s an interesting reflection that as interest grows in cultured food products such as kefir, we’re essentially outsourcing our fermentation function, our having wrecked our gut microbiomes. It comes as no surprise that under favourable symbiotic conditions, microorganisms could produce something rather nutritious. In kefir we have bacteria and fungi working together in an as-yet mysterious way. The point still lost on society is that our bodies are supposed to have this capability.

    </h1>

    <p>Within this review of whole-food nutrition, some facts surrounding gut health:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Prebiotics are an important, and yet often overlooked, food component. Escaping digestion, prebiotics are a class of complex carbohydrates that cannot be broken down by the human enzymatic digestion, are fermented by bacteria in the microbiome, and selectively increase the population of certain species of helpful bacteria. Recent discoveries suggest the intestinal microbiome and a prebiotic-rich, low-caloric diet can play important roles in combating obesity and related diseases. Additionally, consumption of non-digestible, fermentable carbohydrates (or prebiotics) may stimulate the growth and activity of hind gut bacteria by producing short-chain fatty acids that provide an energy source for colonocytes, strengthen the gut mucosal barrier, and suppress colonization of pathogens. As a result, products enriched with prebiotic carbohydrates are becoming more popular health-promoting foods in the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And lentils are proposed as not only a great source of prebiotic fibre, but of iron, zinc, and selenium. Further:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lentils are also a good source of vitamin <span class="sc">A</span>, thiamin, folate, and <span class="sc">β</span>-carotene and also contain considerable amounts of riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine, vitamin <span class="sc">K</span>, and vitamin <span class="sc">E</span>. The limited availability of these vitamins in common food sources makes their presence in lentil highly valuable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A statistically significant decrease in the plaque and gingival indices was noticed from day 7 and the scores continued to decrease during the period of study.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, coconut oil is about 90% saturated fat, of which half is <em>lauric acid</em>, a fatty acid with proven anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects; and “human breast milk is the only other naturally occurring substance with such a high concentration of lauric acid.”</p>

    <p>Though rather limited (covering only 15 individuals), this study may discourage long-term supplementation of ubiquinol – a version of Coenzyme <span class="sc">Q</span>10 (<span class="sc">C</span>o<span class="sc">Q</span>10). Not that it would hurt, but that it may be ineffective.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>And a new piece of the energetic puzzle falls into place. <span class="sc">C</span>o<span class="sc">Q</span>10 is critically involved in the energetic function of cells, and so an athletic body is well used to creating the chemical. Athletes therefore won’t derive the same benefit as non-athletes, for whom the <span class="sc">C</span>o<span class="sc">Q</span>10-synthesizing capability is less practiced, and for whom the stimulating effect of providing the body with an already-prepared ubiquinol are more pronounced.</p>

<p>For older individuals whose body’s energetic function has resigned to a senescent decline, the therapeautic potential of Ubiquinol appears significant: it reminds the cells of the days they were young.</p>

<p>Further to its published purpose, the research seems to reveal the hormetic effect of oxidative stress (which effect seems better evidenced than accepted): exercise is a great way to induce oxidative stress. So why is it good for you? Because the body responds to the challenge. So we have a situation where too little oxidative stress causes senescence, and too much causes damage. The key is to stimulate the body the right amount.</p>

    <p>From <em>frontiers in Psychiatry</em>, this well-written essay investigates the link between food cravings and obesity; and for myself, such referencing of scientific inquiry from domains outside of health and nutrition is highly interesting to me. As someone not painstakingly devoted to a single direction of research, I might discover connections their focused attention neglects.</p>

<p>Noticing that “a rapidly changing food environment may be contributing to the increases in obesity that have been observed over the past 30–40 years,” it is argued that the high availability of highly palatable foods is to blame. In other words, we don’t just eat to restore energy anymore, but also because food that tastes great is super cheap.</p>

<p>Yes, that’s a problem. But the scientific community is also aware that highly-processed foods exert an effect on the dopaminergic system of the brain, putting them into a category with addictions like cocaine, heroin, and alcohol.</p>

    <p>This is the first I learned that users of methamphetamine have to contend with overheating, “a potentially lethal side effect,” and my interest is piqued that the peripheral thermogenic site of <em>brown adipose tissue</em> is chiefly responsible. Here Dr. Sanchez-Alavez and friends explore the ability of the antioxidant <em><span class="sc">N</span>-acetyl cysteine</em> (<span class="sc">NAC</span>) to modulate meth-induced hyperthermia.</p>

<p>What we want generally is to increase our body’s ability to heat itself, through provoking the proliferation of brown adipose tissue. Meth users have the challenge that their brown fat could get super-stimulated and produce so much heat that death is caused. The studied supplement was shown to significantly mitigate (meth-induced) overheating; the mechanism of action looks to be its potent free-radicle-absorbing capability; and <span class="sc">NAC</span> is suggested to be effective in a wider scope of hyperthermia, not only meth-induced:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our results suggest that <span class="sc">NAC</span> is a pharmacological modulator of core body temperature and may have experimental as well as clinical potential to understand and prevent heat illness and death in acute intoxication.</p>

    <p>It was shown that mature, swelling fat cells are far less energetic than younger, slimmer fat cells, whose mitochondrial functioning is superior and who produce much more of the healthy-weight-promoting chemical, <em>adiponectin</em>.</p>

<p>Further:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle is regarded as an important determinant of whole-body insulin sensitivity. A recent study showed that adiponectin increases mitochondrial number and function in skeletal muscle by activating 5-<span class="sc">AMP</span>-activated protein kinase, which is also known to stimulate skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis in response to chronic energy deprivation or endurance training. If so, it is very interesting to find that the synthesis of adiponectin is regulated by mitochondrial function in adipocytes. Thus, there is the possibility that mitochondrial (or metabolic) activity in adipocytes regulates mitochondrial (or metabolic) activity and insulin action in skeletal muscle via adiponectin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, it’s looking like this <em>adiponectin</em> that fat produces exerts a significant sway in how well your muscles work.</p>

    <p>From a state of good health there emanate a number of paths of disease, and while the body is meant to be resilient in returning to health, if pushed far enough, it’ll forget how to get back. One of these paths takes the physiology from a well-governed energetic state to fatal breakdown; from a well-functioning metabolism to one that is deranged.</p>

<p><em>Metabolism</em> should not be so esoteric a term, it’s really a shame. When we read <em>metabolism</em> we ought to realize we’re talking about the most important health metric anybody cares about, the feeling of energy and motivation that makes you feel <em>alive</em>. That’s what metabolism is. When it’s sluggish, you don’t feel like getting out of bed.</p>

<p>When someone has (through inattention or misinformation) pushed his body far enough from a healthy energetic state, when <em>energy</em> becomes problematic, when he begins to have a belly, he has embarked down a descending and darkening way that the scientific community is referring to as <em>metabolic syndrome</em>. There’s a set of symptoms whose suspicious and conspicuous co-occurrence has at length caught the attention of the minds to whom we trust our health understanding: abdominal fat, low-grade inflammation, a sluggish metabolism, heart disease, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes – these conditions, it is being discovered, are all parts of the same problem. And the problem begins as soon as you have a little extra fat in your belly.</p>

<blockquote>

    </h1>

    <p>Humans have two types of fat, <em>white</em> and <em>brown</em>, and both are interesting. Until this century, we didn’t know humans had any brown fat – in fact, the scientific consensus was a firm <em>belief</em> to the contrary. White fat, on the other hand, was believed to be already well-understood.</p>

<p>There has been a resurgence of interest in white fat, and particularly <em>visceral adipose tissue</em> (<span class="sc">VAT</span>), or abdominal fat. Turns out, white adipose tissue is not simply a storage facility for energy, but a fully-fledged organ of the endocrine system: it doesn’t simply store and release energy, but plays a vital role in governing the energetic state of the body.</p>

<p>Abdominal fat has been found to have special meaning in health and wellbeing. When it nears its ‘capacity,’ that is, when the body has to scramble to produce more fat cells to store the excessive consumption, a deleterious feedback loop could be started, and sufferers of inflammatory disorders such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus are those in whom this cycle has been well established.</p>

    <p>Noticing that sufferers of type 2 diabetes are often fat, Dr. Chakraborti analyzes the latest developments in the field to determine the nature of the correlation: she investigates the factors involved in the interplay between obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p>

<p>Adiponectin emerges as having remarkable therapeutic potential:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because of such beneficial involvement in metabolic functions (lipids and carbohydrates), <span class="sc">IR</span> [insulin resistance] and atherosclerosis, this adipokine [adiponectin] is expected to impart protection against coronary heart diseases, steatohepatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases and a wide variety of cancers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This messenger chemical, which keeps you insulin-sensitive and reduces arterial plaque, can mean the difference between being slender and overweight. Your fat cells release it – that is, when they’re healthy, when their mitochondria are highly-functioning. When fat cells become full and bloated, their mitochondrial function is impaired, and less adiponectin is made.</p>

  <p>Specifically, the intestinal immune system has to maintain tolerance to harmless food antigens and commensal microorganisms, yet robustly respond to harmful pathogens.

<p>As conspicuous as the link is between diabetes and magnesium deficit, it raises uncomfortable questions that the matter has not yet received adequate attention by the scientific community.

    <p>Mammals have two types of fat, <em>white</em> and <em>brown</em>: the one stores energy, the other produces heat. Humans were supposed to only have the one type, until recently (within the past decade), scientists took another look. Humans do indeed possess <em>brown adipose tissue</em>, the typically small amounts of it can be increased, and its function is physiologically significant. Understanding the stress that a superfluity of energy presents in the body, anything is health-promoting that alleviates a caloric overabundance: brown fat is able to use up extra calories to raise body temperature.</p>

<p>My personal aim is to arrive at a state of health that is effortless to sustain, and brown fat plays a key role: Through cold exposure, for some three years I have been provoking the cells’ proliferation, and I have witnessed my body’s gradually increasing ability to heat itself. Straightforward thermodynamic calculations could show that simply by turning down the temperature in the room, I’ll burn more calories – and <em>comfortably</em>.</p>

  <p>Roundup was found in this experiment to be 125 times more toxic than glyphosate [the <span class="sc">AP</span>].

    <p>Drs. Samsel and Seneff use the evidence surrounding the related pathologies of celiac disease and gluten intolerance to argue the toxicity of the herbicide Roundup, of which <em>glyphosate</em> is the chief ingredient.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this paper, we have systematically shown how all of these features of celiac disease can be explained by glyphosate’s known properties. These include (1) disrupting the shikimate pathway, (2) altering the balance between pathogens and beneficial biota in the gut, (3) chelating transition metals, as well as sulfur and selenium, and (4) inhibiting cytochrome <span class="sc">P</span>450 enzymes. We argue that a key system-wide pathology in celiac disease is impaired sulfate supply to the tissues, and that this is also a key component of glyphosate’s toxicity to humans.</p>
