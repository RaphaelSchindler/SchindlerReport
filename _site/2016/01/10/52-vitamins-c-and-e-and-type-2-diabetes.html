      <p>They find that taking vitamins <span class="sc">C</span> and <span class="sc">E</span>, in the daily amounts of 1 g and 300 mg, sufferers of type 2 diabetes are much better able to handle inflammatory stress. But why? Is type 2 diabetes simply an out-of-control inflammatory situation, which therefore any antioxidant might improve?</p>

<p>They say having too much of the hormone <em>leptin</em> associates with increased susceptibility to type 2 diabetes; but vitamins <span class="sc">C</span> and <span class="sc">E</span> have been shown to down-regulate leptin; and this is <em>one</em> of the ways these vitamins attenuate the inflammatory response.</p>

<p>And indeed the purpose of the study, essentially, was to see what happens if the inflammation that is the cornerstone of the diabetic pathology was diminished.</p>
