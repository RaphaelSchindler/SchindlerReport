      <p>They find corroborating evidence that long-term cold exposure creates positive changes in the body; brown fat tissue gets activated and the breakdown of fats increases.</p>

<p>To understand how cold-exposure might be health-promoting, you have to be acquainted with the principle of <em>hormesis</em>. The term comes from the study of toxic substances, where it was found that a small dose of a toxin has the opposite effect from a larger dose; whereas a ‘large’ dose may kill you, a ‘tiny’ dose will probably make you healthier. It is somewhat analagous to the adage, ‘what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.’</p>

<p>The key to being healthy is to provoke yourself in the right way (at the right time), and to give yourself the resources needed to respond in a healthy way. So with exercise, we create an oxidative crisis in our body; but the healing response is to revitalizes us. Cold exposure is a way to exercise a part of us we never knew we had – the so-called brown fat, or brown adipose tissue.</p>
