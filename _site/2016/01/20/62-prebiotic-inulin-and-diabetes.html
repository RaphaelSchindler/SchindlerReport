      <p>Here they test whether special fancy-pants sugars called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructooligosaccharide"><em>fructooligosaccharides</em></a> may benefit those with the metabolic condition. I can’t recall the attribution, but I remember hearing that these fructooligosaccharides are sugars which can only be digested by a few organisms, certain healthful bacteria in the gut; and a tactic for encouraging the growth of these beneficial bacteria is to give them food that can’t be taken away from them by gut’s more rapacious and less healthful occupants.</p>

<p>The scientists corroborate my vague assertion: “Oligofructose-enriched inulin can change composition of the gut microflora toward bifidobacteria and lactobacilli.”</p>

<p>And they conclude:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We demonstrated that supplementation with oligofructose-enriched inulin [not a spelling mistake] resulted in a significant decrease in body weight and <span class="sc">BMI</span> [body-mass index].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The exact mechanism(s) of weight reduction by oligofructose–enriched inulin remains unclear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And they unsurprisingly miss the point about the gut’s microflora being altered, and search for more ‘chemical’ reasons for the benefits. I don’t know, but my opinion is that the influence of the gut microbiome on health is not just <em>significant</em>, it’s <em>everything</em>. …I say ‘unsurprisingly’ because even in the last sixty days of reading through scientific research in the domain of health and nutrition, I have seen the marked biases from the influences of: first, free-market capitalism, which determines which health questions receive attention; and second, of dogmatic education and herd mentality (even in the scientific community), which slows down radical shifts in scientific awareness.</p>

<p>Let’s put it this way: they can’t be right about everything; they must be quite wrong in certain fundamental assertions; and I believe this is one of them. The health community at large is yet to wake up to the reality that humans and microorganisms interact symbiotically.</p>

<p>On a recent ski trip to Revelstoke (not that it matters, but…jealous?), in the mid-mountain lodge there was a hand-sanitizing stand, above which was posted the message “Health begins with clean hands.” I think that statement must be categorically wrong. Health ‘begins’ with nature; and nature isn’t sterile.</p>
