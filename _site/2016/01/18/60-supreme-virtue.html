      <blockquote>
  <p>Can you coax your mind from its wandering<br />
and keep to the original oneness?<br />
Can you let your body become<br />
supple as a newborn child’s?<br />
Can you cleanse your inner vision<br />
until you see nothing but the light?<br />
Can you love people and lead them<br />
without imposing your will?<br />
Can you deal with the most vital matters<br />
by letting events take their course?<br />
Can you step back from your own mind<br />
and thus understand all things?<br />
Giving birth and nourishing,<br />
having without possessing,<br />
acting with no expectations,<br />
leading and not trying to control:<br />
this is the supreme virture.</p>
</blockquote>
