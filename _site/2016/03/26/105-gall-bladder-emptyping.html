  <p>The emptying of the gall bladder in response to feeding is pivotal for the digestion of fat, but the role of various food ingredients in contracting the gall bladder postprandially [i.e. after a meal] is not well understood.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I learned:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(As already stated) gall bladder emptying is pivotal for the digestion of fat.</li>
  <li>The gall bladder is like a little bulb, complete with its own sphincter (so now you have two!), that through squeezing itself and control of the sphincter injects a fluid into the digestive system, and the ‘injection site’ is the <em>duodenum</em>, which is the tube leaving the stomach.</li>
  <li>The injected fluid, <em>bile</em>, is what causes the digestion of fats.</li>
  <li>The gall bladder empties different amounts of bile depending on what was eaten.</li>
</ul>
