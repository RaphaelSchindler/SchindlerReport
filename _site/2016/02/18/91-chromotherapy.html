      <p>An illuminating introduction to the field of light therapy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many aspects of humankindâ€™s explorations are ignored, neglected or discarded. Color medicine is one of these neglected items. The common feature of every remedial and curative system of treatment, whether it is Ayurveda, allopathy, acupuncture, Unani, homeopathy, biochemic, magnetotherapy, physiotherapy, radiotherapy, aromatherapy, reflexology or chromotherapy, is to somehow apply vibrations of one kind or another in such a manner that the body can be put back on the health track. Most systems induce vibrations indirectly, but there are a few in which the vibrations are used directly upon the body, and chromotherapy is one of them.</p>
