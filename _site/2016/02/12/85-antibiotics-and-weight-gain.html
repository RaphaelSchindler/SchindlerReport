      <p>This 1986 article is illuminating on the practice of administering antibiotics to our agricultural animals.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Antibiotics have been fed at subtherapeutic levels to improve weight gain and efficiency of feed utilization. This husbandry technique has been practiced since the 1950s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We still don’t know why antibiotic-use leads to weight gain, but it does, and the agricultural industry knows this very well.</p>

<p>What is extremely fascinating to me is that we can’t seem to accept that we too are mammals, and this weight-gain effect applies to us. It’s fascinating because human psychology operates to obscure the discovery of an important truth.</p>
