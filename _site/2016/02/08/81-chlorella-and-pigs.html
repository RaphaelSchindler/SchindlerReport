      <p>This research interests me not for its face value, but for two collateral observations: first, that the study authors view the ‘fermentation step’ as being so nutritive and effective a measure to include in feed systems, that they even embarked on this research to improve the already-nutrient-dense Chlorella. But they observe something I found fascinating, second, regarding the ‘average daily gain’ metric – the amount of a pig’s daily weight gain. They observe:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is evident from the current study that pig fed antibiotic supplemented diet led to a higher <span class="sc">ADG</span> [average daily gain].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very interesting indeed. This would corroborate what (I’ve heard) has been known for some time in the domain of raising cattle – you give them antibiotics and they get fatter.</p>
