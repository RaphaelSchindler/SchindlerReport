      <p>They conclude:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Guava leaves extract could serve as functional food for managing gout and hypertension and attenuating the oxidative stress associated with both diseases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The phytochemicals of interest to the scientists were the polyphenols (or phenolics), which are flavonoids and phenolic acids. These are what they think reduces gout and hypertension.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The phenolics composition of the guava leaves extract revealed that it contained the flavonoids: Quercetin, kaempferol, catechin, quercitrin, rutin, luteolin, and epicatechin; with quercetin being the most abundant flavonoid, followed by kaempferol. The result further revealed that the extract contained the phenolic acids: Caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and gallic acids; with caffeic acid, followed by chlorogenic acid as the most abundant.</p>
