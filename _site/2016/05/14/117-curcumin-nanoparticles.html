  <p>Curcumin has been associated with many pharmacological activities which include antiproliferative, anticancer, antiangiogenic, antidiabetic, antioxidant and antiinflammatory activities.

<p>So here is research that illuminates the effectiveness of curcumin as a supplement. This paper looks to me to be making a case for the (proprietary?) technology of nanoparticles as a way to deliver the drug. I’m suspicious about the limitations mentioned, because isn’t it convenient to find fault with the unpatentable substance. It’s like poo-pooing cannabis compared with pharmacologically-modified cannabis, because obviously the latter is a money-maker, and the former, not so much.</p>

<p>Hmm. I wonder if consuming turmeric is superior to consuming the extracted curcumin. I wonder if the absorption improves if the substance is ingested in its natural ‘medium.’</p>
