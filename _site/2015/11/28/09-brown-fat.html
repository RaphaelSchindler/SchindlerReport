      <p>Mammals have two types of fat, <em>white</em> and <em>brown</em>: the one stores energy, the other produces heat. Humans were supposed to only have the one type, until recently (within the past decade), scientists took another look. Humans do indeed possess <em>brown adipose tissue</em>, the typically small amounts of it can be increased, and its function is physiologically significant. Understanding the stress that a superfluity of energy presents in the body, anything is health-promoting that alleviates a caloric overabundance: brown fat is able to use up extra calories to raise body temperature.</p>

<p>My personal aim is to arrive at a state of health that is effortless to sustain, and brown fat plays a key role: Through cold exposure, for some three years I have been provoking the cells’ proliferation, and I have witnessed my body’s gradually increasing ability to heat itself. Straightforward thermodynamic calculations could show that simply by turning down the temperature in the room, I’ll burn more calories – and <em>comfortably</em>.</p>
