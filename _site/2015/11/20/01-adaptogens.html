      <p><em>Adaptogens</em> are the new <em>stimulants</em>: Whereas the psychotropic stimulants such as amphetamine or cocaine showed impressive metabolic up-regulation, producing the pleasing effects of an astoundingly energized physiology; when the overall influence proved rather harmful than healthful, pharmacologists began to look elsewhere.
