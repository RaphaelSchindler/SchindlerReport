      <p>From a state of good health there emanate a number of paths of disease, and while the body is meant to be resilient in returning to health, if pushed far enough, it’ll forget how to get back. One of these paths takes the physiology from a well-governed energetic state to fatal breakdown; from a well-functioning metabolism to one that is deranged.</p>

<p><em>Metabolism</em> should not be so esoteric a term, it’s really a shame. When we read <em>metabolism</em> we ought to realize we’re talking about the most important health metric anybody cares about, the feeling of energy and motivation that makes you feel <em>alive</em>. That’s what metabolism is. When it’s sluggish, you don’t feel like getting out of bed.</p>

<p>When someone has (through inattention or misinformation) pushed his body far enough from a healthy energetic state, when <em>energy</em> becomes problematic, when he begins to have a belly, he has embarked down a descending and darkening way that the scientific community is referring to as <em>metabolic syndrome</em>. There’s a set of symptoms whose suspicious and conspicuous co-occurrence has at length caught the attention of the minds to whom we trust our health understanding: abdominal fat, low-grade inflammation, a sluggish metabolism, heart disease, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes – these conditions, it is being discovered, are all parts of the same problem. And the problem begins as soon as you have a little extra fat in your belly.</p>
