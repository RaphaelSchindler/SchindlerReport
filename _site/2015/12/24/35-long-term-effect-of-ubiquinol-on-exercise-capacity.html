      <p><em>Ubiquinol</em>, the reduced form of Coenzyme <span class="sc">Q</span>10 (<span class="sc">C</span>o<span class="sc">Q</span>10), is shown to raise exercise capacity in a mouse model. Ubiquinol both provokes an energetic-state and helps with the oxidative-stress cleanup.</p>

<p>Further to its published purpose, the research seems to reveal the hormetic effect of oxidative stress (which effect seems better evidenced than accepted): exercise is a great way to induce oxidative stress. So why is it good for you? Because the body responds to the challenge. So we have a situation where too little oxidative stress causes senescence, and too much causes damage. The key is to stimulate the body the right amount.</p>
