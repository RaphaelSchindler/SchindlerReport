      <p>It’s well-known that consuming Spirulina is health-promoting; this study gives me insight into dosages – <em>some</em> insight, at least, as this was a rat model. But the study animals were made to consume 500 mg of Spirulina per kg of body mass. For me, at roughly 80 kg, I’d have to consume 40 g of Spirulina daily to be on par, and that is an amount much greater than I have ever considered.</p>
