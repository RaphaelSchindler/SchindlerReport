  <p>Diabetes is frequently associated with <span class="sc">M</span>g [magnesium] deficit. â€¦ Future prospective <span class="sc">RCT</span>s [randomized controlled trials] are needed to support the potential role of dietary Mg [magnesium] supplementation as a possible public health strategy to reduce diabetes risk in the population.</p>

<p>As conspicuous as the link is between diabetes and magnesium deficit, it raises uncomfortable questions that the matter has not yet received adequate attention by the scientific community. Free-market dynamics give preference to capital-generating activity, and so we cannot be surprised when a majority of funding goes into the lucrative area of pharmaceutical research rather than into exploring a micronutrient that, say it was found effective, would not only be unprofitable, but would pose a serious competitive risk to established vested interests.</p>
