      <p>Ultrasonographic technology was used to measure the effects to the skin of a novel vitamin-<span class="sc">C</span>-containing topical formulation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our study shows that topically applied vitamin <span class="sc">C</span> is highly efficient as a rejuvenation therapy, inducing significant collagen synthesis in all age groups with minimal side effects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Vitamin <span class="sc">C</span> has long been thought to possess such rejuvenating potential, but with current technology we are better able to measure just how well it works. The treated skin actually became <em>thicker</em>.</p>

<p>The challenges surrounding vitamin <span class="sc">C</span> for topical use have been the molecule’s instability, absorption by the skin, and since it’s an acid, the skin can tolerate only a modest dilution (here the formula contained only 5%). On the forefront of skincare are emerging technologies that mitigate these factors.</p>
