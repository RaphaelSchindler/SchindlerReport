      <p>Noticing that sufferers of type 2 diabetes are often fat, Dr. Chakraborti analyzes the latest developments in the field to determine the nature of the correlation: she investigates the factors involved in the interplay between obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p>

<p>Adiponectin emerges as having remarkable therapeutic potential:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because of such beneficial involvement in metabolic functions (lipids and carbohydrates), <span class="sc">IR</span> [insulin resistance] and atherosclerosis, this adipokine [adiponectin] is expected to impart protection against coronary heart diseases, steatohepatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases and a wide variety of cancers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This messenger chemical, which keeps you insulin-sensitive and reduces arterial plaque, can mean the difference between being slender and overweight. Your fat cells release it – that is, when they’re healthy, when their mitochondria are highly-functioning. When fat cells become full and bloated, their mitochondrial function is impaired, and less adiponectin is made.</p>
